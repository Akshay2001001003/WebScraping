###Car Brand Data Scraper and Database Updater
This Python script scrapes data from a specific webpage, processes it, and updates a PostgreSQL database with the retrieved information. Additionally, it exports the data to a CSV file for further analysis or storage.

Overview
The script performs the following tasks:

Web Scraping: Utilizes BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries to scrape data from spinny.com, specifically targeting the top-selling car brands in India.

Data Processing: Extracts relevant information such as brand name, units sold, year-over-year growth percentage, and market share percentage from the scraped HTML table.

Database Interaction: Connects to a PostgreSQL database, clears the existing data in the Car_Brand table, and inserts the freshly scraped data.

CSV Export: Saves the scraped data into a CSV file named car_brand_data.csv.

Requirements
Python 3.x
BeautifulSoup (bs4)
Requests
psycopg2 (PostgreSQL adapter)
PostgreSQL
Usage
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests psycopg2
Database Setup:

Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
Create a database named postgres.
Execute the SQL script schema.sql to create the Car_Brand table within the postgres database.
Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python car_brand_scraper.py
Output:

The script updates the PostgreSQL database with the latest data.
The scraped data is exported to car_brand_data.csv.
Customization
Database Configuration: Modify the PostgreSQL connection parameters (database, user, password, host, port) in the script according to your PostgreSQL setup.
Target URL: If the source webpage URL changes or if the HTML structure is modified, adjust the URL and parsing logic accordingly in the script.
CSV Output File: You can change the filename and directory for the CSV output by modifying the csv_file variable in the script.
Notes
This script assumes a stable internet connection for web scraping.
Ensure the PostgreSQL database is accessible and properly configured before running the script.
It's advisable to schedule this script to run at specific intervals to keep the database updated with the latest data.
